I shut it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just some of the reasons I tell myself I don’t want something:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s not possible, so I don’t really want it.</li><li>I don’t think I can achieve it, so focus on the doable.</li><li>Others might be able to do it, but I can’t.</li><li>I don’t have the discipline to stick to this, I can’t trust myself.</li><li>I don’t have the money for it, it would be irresponsible.</li><li>I don’t have time, I’m too busy.</li><li>I would feel guilty if I allowed myself to have this.</li><li>Other people would judge me if I gave this to myself.</li><li>The other person would reject me if I asked for it.</li><li>It&#8217;s too complicated.</li><li>It’s not worth all the effort.</li><li>I shouldn’t want this.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Do any of these sound familiar to you?

It’s amazing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, if you are setting out to create a masterpiece … what does that do to you when you show up at the blank page or canvas? It can bring immense fear of not being able to produce that masterpiece, or worries of falling short of our hopes and dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These kind of expectations can often crush any creativity we start out with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So should we have zero goals or expectations, have no standards, and no hopes and dreams? Or should we just not even try?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say let yourself show up and create, from a place of aliveness. Of play, adventure, creativity, joy. From a place of dance, music, and delight in the chaos of life. From abundance and inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the place of creation, we don’t need to burden ourselves with high expectations. See what flows from your heart, imagination, and joyful being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, we’ll need to bring in our craft, and refine. Edit, toss out, and discern.

It just takes some training. And lots of practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s imagine you&#8217;re feeling stressed right now, about whatever you need to do, about an interpersonal conflict, about something coming up in the near future &#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is it that&#8217;s stressing you out about this? You might start telling me all the details of the situation, or all the things the other person has done wrong &#8230; but that&#8217;s your narrative about it. The thing that&#8217;s stressing you out is the narrative, or how you view the situation or person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could let go of that view, and just be in this present moment, without the narrative? There can be a feeling of peace and openness. Try it right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the training. Relax the narrative, loosen your view, and drop into the openness of the present moment. Breathe deeply, and relax your body. Relax the jaw, relax the muscles in your torso. Feel the openness in this moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With training, you can do this as you go into a stressful meeting, or enter a chaotic scene, or have a difficult conversation. But start with the easier situations: when you&#8217;re on your laptop, or washing a dish. When you&#8217;re out for a walk, or talking with a friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breathe, relax, let go of the view and narrative, and find the peaceful openness of the present moment.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net/relaxed/\">Training to Be Relaxed in Stressful Situations</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net\">zen habits</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>A Well Lived Life of Purpose</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/well-lived-life/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 14:28:04 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20857</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>By Leo Babauta Most of the people I know and work with want a life of meaning and purpose, not a life where we just get by &#8230; A well lived life, that feels meaningful.

How important is that to you? Are you willing to move into uncertainty for this, or is comfort and safety more important to you at the moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To commit, you have to commit in the gut. To tell yourself that this is important enough to devote yourself to, to dedicate time, to practice with the uncdertainty. Commit to yourself, on paper. Then to others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"exploration\">Exploration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to consder is embarking on an adventure of exploring your purpose, if you don&#8217;t already have a good sense of it. It&#8217;s not as simple as asking, &#8220;What would I like to do?&#8221; or doing a web search for the answer. You have to explore it, and bringing a sense of adventure might be just the right approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I usually recommend exploring purpose:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Make a list of things that you think might be meaningful to you — helping children in need, helping people reduce stress, traveling to help communities in need, etc. Put anything on the list that&#8217;s even remotely possible or interesting, don&#8217;t limit yourself here. Hint: I&#8217;ve found that the most meaningful things are when you&#8217;re helping other people with something you care about.</li><li>Ask yourself which 3-5 of these would be most meaningful. If one really stands out — maybe it&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;ve been wanting to do for years — then that&#8217;s where to start. But maybe you&#8217;re not sure, so pick 3-5. This is your short list.</li><li>Of those, let your gut choose the top one. If you absolutely don&#8217;t know, either choose randomly, or ask a friend. This isn&#8217;t your final answer, but just the one you&#8217;re going to start with.</li><li>Choose a 2-week version of this top possibility. For example, if you want to help people with stress, could you help 1 person over video calls and email for 2 weeks? This is the mini-version of your possible purpose. Explore this for 2 weeks, really pouring yourself into it.</li><li>If this really resonates, make a one-month version of it and continue to explore. If it doesn&#8217;t, pick the next thing on your short list. Do a 2-week version of that. Repeat until you find something to explore for a month or longer.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the iterative method of purpose exploration. You try a mini-version of something for a couple weeks. Maybe longer. And keep doing this until you hit on something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice if you feel like avoiding this process, or a part of the process. This is your uncertainty showing up as fear. That&#8217;s completely OK, but you might ask whether you&#8217;d like to get support with that uncertainty, so you don&#8217;t have to be stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-well-lived-life\">A Well Lived Life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are an infinite number of possibilities for living a well lived life. You might meditate on a mountain for years, or enjoy the simple things. You might enjoy time with loved ones, or explore culinary pleasures. You might read all day, or listen to music. You might get your work done, and come home satisfied from a job well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, one of the biggest components of a well lived life — other than loved ones and a profound appreciation of life — is doing something that feels meaningful. And that has usually been helping others with something that&#8217;s meaningful to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can serve others, make their lives better in some small way (or a big way) &#8230; it feels incredibly meaningful. Much more than simply traveling or building up wealth or enjoying good food or having fun. Those are all great, but they don&#8217;t feel as meaningful to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can hit on something like that, that feels meaningful &#8230; then a well lived life becomes simple:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend quality time with loved ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take care of yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find profound appreciation for the joy of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And serve others in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, but not always easy. And that makes it even richer.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net/well-lived-life/\">A Well Lived Life of Purpose</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net\">zen habits</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Wanting More Time for Your Meaningful Work</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/meaningful-work-time/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20849</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>By Leo Babauta A member of my Fearless Training Program has a full-time business that she loves, but isn&#8217;t the meaningful work she&#8217;d like to do in the world.

She struggles with finding enough time for that meaningful work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you relate to this? The rest of our life fills up all the space — how can we find enough time to focus on what&#8217;s really important?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a common problem for anyone who wants to launch a new venture, volunteer, create art, write a book, build an audience or a brand &#8230; how do we create the time when we&#8217;re already busy and overloaded?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to share some ideas in this article:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Create structure for all the stuff in your life</li><li>Create even more space</li><li>Really pour yourself into it</li><li>Bring some Zen to disruptions &amp; frustrations</li><li>Replenish yourself</li><li>Bring freedom, joy &amp; lit-upness to any activity</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These are all meant to address various problems that we face when we&#8217;re making time for our meaningful work. You can decide which ones might apply to your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"create-structure-in-your-life\">Create Structure in Your Life</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our lives can feel overwhelming, with too many things to do! We have chores and small tasks and messages to answer, bills to pay, dishes to wash, people to contact, and much more. So how do we handle all of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it can feel overwhelming when it&#8217;s a huge pile of stuff and seemingly not enough time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, the small stuff will overwhelm all the available space, because it always feels urgent when we&#8217;re feeling behind and overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one good answer is to create structure. Create spaces to deal with all the things in your life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Bill Pay Mondays</li><li>Inbox Zero Tuesdays</li><li>Admin Fridays</li><li>House Chore Party Saturdays</li><li>Email and messages Sacred Hour &#8211; daily at 4pm</li><li>Morning planning &amp; intentions</li><li>Monthly taxes day</li><li>Meaningful Work Play Time at 10am daily</li><li>And so on</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not these specific spaces — your structure will be different than these. But if you have a space for all the stuff, you can relax and know that it will be taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What structure can you create to take care of everything important, while creating structured and intentional space for your meaningful work?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"create-even-more-space\">Create Even More Space</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re so busy that you can only find 30 minutes a week for your meaningful work — it&#8217;s a great start! But take it as a starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you can create more time by bundling your emails and messages into a certain hour each day. Maybe you can free up some time by hiring a babysitter, a house cleaner, someone on Craigslist to haul away your junk for you. Someone to answer your customer service emails, or an admin asssitant to take care of routine tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe you can eliminate or simplify some things to create more space. Get out of commitments. Tell people No. Ask for postponements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we can cut out distractions, like social media or video watching or news/website reading. If we&#8217;re honest, there&#8217;s a lot of wasted time in our days that can be streamlined for the sake of what&#8217;s truly important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get creative! Sometimes it takes a little time investment to simplify, but then it pays off in space in a week or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"really-pour-yourself-into-it\">Really Pour Yourself Into It</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have the space, it can be hard to focus. All the other stuff is calling to you! Maybe you spend the first 20 minutes of the 40 minutes you&#8217;ve carved out just getting ready. Maybe the whole focus block gets pushed back until later because you feel something else is more urgent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create the structure to make the meaningful work happen. Sometimes it means doing it on a video call with someone else — each of you do your meaningful work on mute for an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when you&#8217;re in the focus block — pour yourself into it. Give it your full being. Be all in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t half ass it. Whole ass it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bring-some-zen-to-disruptions\">Bring Some Zen to Disruptions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we get disrupted. Our kid interrupts wanting a snack. Our spouse interrupts with their latest frustration. A message comes in that sidetracks us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we can get frustrated or angry. That&#8217;s normal! Give yourself a breath or two, and some compassion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then let it go. Relax, breathe, and accept the interruption as just a natural part of the chaos of life. It doesn&#8217;t have to derail you completely. See the gift in the interruption. Find the gratitude for having this person in your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then simply return to the meaningful task, with your whole self.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"replenish-yourself\">Replenish Yourself</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard to find focus when we&#8217;re drained, anxious, exhausted, feeling resigned &amp; resentful. We just don&#8217;t have the focus or capacity to face anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it can be a great act of leadership to recognize this, and take care of it. A great act of generosity to yourself and your meaningful work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recharge your batteries, give yourself nurturing and nourishment, replenish yourself so that you can return with full life force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ideas:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get more sleep — shut down earlier and let yourself relax into deep, nourishing sleep.</li><li>Get outdoors daily. Go for a walk or run, enjoy the quiet beauty of nature.</li><li>Take a hot bath. Drink some tea while doing nothing else. Take some space.</li><li>Any kind of self-care is helpful: a nap, yoga, a workout, therapy, talk with a friend, get a massage, meditate.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>More space, more relaxing, more nourishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bring-freedom-joy-lit-upness-to-every-activity\">Bring Freedom, Joy &amp; Lit-upness to Every Activity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can feel trapped because we&#8217;re craving freedom, but our day job isn&#8217;t allowing for it. We can feel drained and discouraged because our day job feels draining, stressful, dull.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way! We can bring joy and freedom to any activity, including our routine work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would it be like to do the activity you normally experience as suffocating &#8230; with a sense of freedom and joy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could do the dull routine activities with vitality? What if you could be lit up in any moment you liked?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a possibility few people allow themselves. I encourage you to explore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could your life be like, bringing freedom and joy to anything you liked?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net/meaningful-work-time/\">Wanting More Time for Your Meaningful Work</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net\">zen habits</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Delight in Uncertainty</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/delight/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2021 13:08:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncertainty & Discomfort]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20846</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>By Leo Babauta Most of us have a troubled relationship with uncertainty, often without even knowing it.

We don&#8217;t like uncertainty, we want to avoid or control uncertainty, we get stressed when we can&#8217;t. And uncertainty is unavoidable: everything is uncertain all the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that uncertainty doesn&#8217;t have to be this terrible thing that we hate and need to avoid. In fact &#8230; we can find joy in uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can delight in uncertainty, and fall in love with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new relationship with uncertainty can unlock so much for us — freedom and joy and the ability to take on whatever we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"finding-the-delight-in-uncertainty\">Finding the Delight in Uncertainty</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We might instinctively dislike uncertainty, but in truth, we would be so bored without it. Imagine watching a movie and always knowing how it turns out, or reading the same book over and over. We want surprise, adventure, and possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uncertainty is the place where we learn — if we are certain about something, there&#8217;s nothing new to learn. It&#8217;s the place where we form intimate relationships, create art, make something new. It&#8217;s the place of discovery, play, dance, growth. It&#8217;s the pre-requisite for all of this!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect with the times when you&#8217;ve felt the most meaning and joy: these times were filled with delicious uncertainty!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine going out into the unknown, on an adventure, and find the delight in the uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine doing something meaningful for someone, with uncertainty along for the ride, adding so much meaning to the endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine the uncertainty and dance of a new relationship, the vulnerability and discovery of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice the uncertainty in your life right now: is there a way you could be grateful for it? Can you savor it, like a delicious desert? Can you delight in it, like a newly discovered aria?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you allow yourself to open to it, and fall in love with the uncertainty of your life?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-practice\">How to Practice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this doesn&#8217;t come naturally to most of us. We like our routine, we like our control, we like solid ground under our feet. Unfortunately, life doesn&#8217;t let us have that solid ground. Or maybe I should say &#8220;fortunately,&#8221; because life would be dull and meaningless without groundlessness and uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So &#8230; how can we learn to delight in the uncertainty? Practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the practice you might try:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Notice the uncertainty in a task</strong>. A good signal that you&#8217;re feeling uncertainty is that you feel like avoiding it. If that&#8217;s the case, notice how turning towards the task (even thinking about it) causes you to feel, as a bodily sensation. This is how uncertainty feels in your body!</li><li><strong>Commit to dancing with it</strong>. Turning away from the uncertainty gives you certain predictable results in your life. What would it be like to do something different? Commit to doing something different: face it, be with it, dance with it. Give yourself 10 minutes to be with the uncertainty of this task.</li><li><strong>See the opportunity in the task, see the joy in it</strong>. What could you do with this task that would light you up?</li><li><strong>Let yourself move, physically</strong>. Get up, and move. Dance, do some exercise, walk, jump! If we&#8217;re stuck sitting, it&#8217;s harder to feel delight. We need to move. And to really see what the world is like in this moment — look around, find the delight in this everchanging moment, and full appreciation for life!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What delight can you find in this task, in this moment? Keep practicing, each day, and see what happens in your life!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net/delight/\">Delight in Uncertainty</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net\">zen habits</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Getting Good at Just Starting a Difficult Task</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/starting-task/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Productivity & Organization]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20843</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>By Leo Babauta The tendency to put off difficult tasks that we don&#8217;t want to face is almost universal.

We feel uncertainty, fear, stress, overwhelm about the task. Or it makes us feel bad about ourselves, inadequate in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like opening a box that you know is goig to cause you pain —&nbsp;<em>of course</em>&nbsp;you&#8217;d put off opening the box! We want to protect ourselves from that kind of stress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can force ourselves to touch the electric fence, but that can only last for so long. We only want to put ourselves through so much pain before we start to question why we&#8217;re making ourselves suffer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opportunity is in finding a new way of seeing these tasks — instead of filled with overwhelm, stress and inadequacy &#8230; can we find a more powerful way of seeing the uncertainty of this task? Can it be an opportunity, an adventure, a playground, an expression of our art? Can it be a dance of joy, a powerful way to serve others with love?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find that for yourself. What is the opportunity of this task? What would make it meaningful and joyful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect to that before you start, and things will get easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-start\">How to Start</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve taken a look at how you&#8217;re viewing the task, and find a new way to view it &#8230; you&#8217;re ready to train yourself at starting!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I recommend:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Pick a task that&#8217;s important/meaningful, but that you&#8217;ve been putting off</strong>. Usually it&#8217;s easy to find one. Look at your list, think about what you&#8217;ve been avoiding. Pick one, even if it&#8217;s a fairly random choice, it doesn&#8217;t matter.</li><li><strong>Find a way to make it meaningful &amp; joyful</strong>. How can you view this task so that it serves others, that it&#8217;s an adventure or play, that it feels powerful opportunity? Even just a little bit is good. Connect to that.</li><li><strong>Shrink down the task</strong>. YOu don&#8217;t have to do the whole thing. Just a bit of it. For example, instead of having to write this whole blog post, I can focus on just writing the first few paragraphs. This will help lower resistance, because</li><li><strong>Clear everything away</strong>. Close your browser, disconnect your phone, close applications. Remove distractions. Give yourself the gift of simplicity.</li><li><strong>Dive in joyfully</strong>. You only need to start. You can work on staying with the task later. Just start! See it as a dance, a way to serve, a way to bring the full vitality of your being! Pour yourself in.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Appreciate this act of starting. It&#8217;s delicious and profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-practice-the-art-of-the-start\">How to Practice the Art of the Start</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An amazing way to practice this is to set yourself a challenge to do this once a day, 5 days a week, for a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing it just once a day, you&#8217;ll relieve yourself of the pressure of trying to do it all day long. You can be deliberate about it and find a way of viewing the task that feels powerful and joyful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing it most days in the week, for a month, you will get better at it quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some additional tips:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Keep a simple journal</strong>. Write down things that help and things that don&#8217;t help. Use it as a learning log.</li><li><strong>Do a short review every week</strong>. I recommend having people you report to, so that you&#8217;re sharing it with others, like an accountability group.</li><li><strong>Do it with others if it helps</strong>. That means you might meet someone on Zoom once a day where you each tackle the things that you&#8217;ve been putting off. It gives you the little push you need to start.</li><li><strong>Enjoy the practice</strong>! Don&#8217;t make this a sacrifice, another burden in your life. Make it a playful, joyful adventure. Something that feels meaningful and delicious.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I also highly recommend my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fearless.zenhabits.net/\">Fearless Training Program</a>, where we work on this together.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net/starting-task/\">Getting Good at Just Starting a Difficult Task</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net\">zen habits</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Becoming Trustable</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/trustable/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:13:39 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Intimacy & Whole-Hearted Connection]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20840</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>By Leo Babauta As a husband, a father, a man &#8230; one of the things I crave most is for my loved ones to trust me.

It&#8217;s something I want with my team, my readers, my coaching clients, the members of my Sea Change and Fearless Training programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve worked hard over the years to become more trustable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really a magical thing, when people start trusting you. When your wife and kids trust you, it can melt your heart. They can relax, and feel taken care of. When your clients trust you, you can go deeper with them. When you trust yourself, you can relax more in any activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s magic in becoming trustable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I&#8217;d like to share some of what I&#8217;ve learned. To be clear: I am not perfect, and I don&#8217;t always do everything perfectly. This isn&#8217;t about perfection, but about being someone that people can count on — including taking responsibility when you&#8217;ve fallen short of what they were expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"an-example-what-happens-in-a-marriage-when-you-re-trustable\">An Example: What Happens in a Marriage When You&#8217;re Trustable</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A marriage is a great example of where the magic of trustability can transform things. In a marriage, one partner will crave the radiant love (not necessarily sexual love) of the other partner — a husband craving the abundant feminine love of his wife, for example. (Note: This can apply to any gendered relationship — I&#8217;m going to use man/woman because that&#8217;s the one I know best.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But she can&#8217;t fully give her radiant love and affection if she can&#8217;t relax. And she can&#8217;t relax if she&#8217;s always worried about whether things are going to be taken care of, anxious about whether her life is safe, whether you&#8217;re going to follow through on what you said you&#8217;d do. I can&#8217;t tell you how many men I&#8217;ve worked with who said this is one of their wives&#8217; main complaint!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When our partner doesn&#8217;t trust us and complains that we don&#8217;t do what we say we&#8217;re going to do &#8230; we can take that as criticism. We can say, &#8220;Why does she always have to complain about me??&#8221; But what we&#8217;re missing is truly getting her experience, of having to worry about things she doesn&#8217;t want to worry about. She feels tense, and she can&#8217;t relax enough to give her radiant love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When they can relax, and know that things are taken care of &#8230; they can give their love more easily and abundantly. Which is what we crave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the magic comes when we become trustable — all of a sudden, they can relax more. And their love flows more easily and abundantly. It&#8217;s a wonderful magic!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out, this is how all relationships often work, including professional relationships — when they can trust us and relax, a deeper relationship can form. Magic happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-become-more-trustable\">How to Become More Trustable</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we understand how all of the above works &#8230; then the question becomes, &#8220;How do I become more trustable?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my answer is that it doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. And it&#8217;s a never-ending process, like any kind of mastery. You&#8217;re never done growing in this area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is possible to grow tremendously here!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to give some of the key learnings here:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do your best to practice keeping your word</strong>. That means when you say you&#8217;re going to do something, really commit to making that happen. Sometimes that means sacrificing some comfort to make it happen. But make it a top priority, and take it seriously.</li><li><strong>When you can&#8217;t keep your word, own up to it</strong>. Let them know ahead of time if you&#8217;re not able to do it. If you messed up, take responsibility and apologize, and let them know what you&#8217;ll do going forward to avoid the same mistake repeating. Do what you need to do to fix things.</li><li><strong>Breathe deeply and slow down</strong>. When we&#8217;re jumpy and anxious, they will feel it. When we stand solidly, breathe deeply, and go slower &#8230; they feel this as solidity and trustability. As with all of this, it&#8217;s a learning process — you&#8217;ll have moments of anxiety, but you can learn to breathe deeply even here. You&#8217;ll have moments of fidgetyness and jumpiness &#8230; but you can learn to slow down even here, with practice.</li><li><strong>Create structure for yourself and them</strong>. When you are committed to making certain things happen (taking care of the car, getting the groceries, paying the bills) &#8230; it will help greatly to have structure, like a schedule with reminders. When will this get taken care of? You might alter the structure, but having a structure for you and those around you helps them to know that things are in order and will be taken care of. Practice creating structure for others when it would serve them (without forcing it on them) — offer a plan, a schedule, a clear decision, an agreement.</li><li><strong>When they complain about something you haven&#8217;t done &#8230; listen</strong>. Hold space for their complaint, and instead of taking it personally, see if there&#8217;s some way you can help them. But listen first, and get them. Then see what you can do to make it right, to create structure so they can trust it will get done, to clean up any mess you&#8217;ve accidentally made. You don&#8217;t need to feel blame or shame, but just get them.</li><li><strong>Take things seriously</strong>. But not too seriously! OK, it&#8217;s good to have a sense of humor &#8230; but if you dismiss their concerns, or say, &#8220;Yeah yeah don&#8217;t worry&#8221; &#8230; they will worry. They can&#8217;t trust that you&#8217;re going to do your best. Give it your all. Hear their concerns. Make it clear that you&#8217;re going to take care of it.</li><li><strong>Take full responsibility</strong>. Especially when you want to blame them. Instead of pointing the finger &#8230; look at what you might have done to contribute to this, or to allow this situation to happen. Have you not been clear? Have you not created an agreement around this? Have you not been acknowledging them for how great they are? Have you not been taking care of things? When you think you shouldn&#8217;t have to take on responsibility — that&#8217;s when you can take on more.</li><li><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. If you can&#8217;t take care of yourself, how can you be trusted to take care of them? This means clean up your messes, put things in order, do some basic personal hygiene, take care of your emotions, give yourself rest when you&#8217;re feeling stressed or burned out. Being trustable doesn&#8217;t mean you have to take on so much that you&#8217;re overworked.</li><li><strong>Always look for ways to be more trustable</strong>. Where have you dropped the ball? Is there something you could do to feel more solid to them? Where have you avoided taking on responsibility? Where have you let things lapse into a mess? This is a continual area of growth. You don&#8217;t have to be perfect, but you can continue to grow.

I still have it, on a daily basis. It&#8217;s not rational, but then fear never is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fear will control us if we don&#8217;t bring a kind awareness to it, and start to work with us. It will own us, and we&#8217;ll always be checking our phones, replying to messages, stuck in perpetual motion. Rest becomes difficult, joy becomes mostly inaccessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I work with this guilt and fear:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Recognize it when it&#8217;s happening</strong>. When it&#8217;s late in the day, and we could be wrapping things up and closing our work day &#8230; notice the urge to do more. Notice the guilt of stopping. Just bring awareness to the fear and guilt, without judging them or needing them to go away.</li><li><strong>Breathe, and feel it</strong>. Pause, take a few deep breaths, and don&#8217;t let yourself buy into the fear. Feel the physical sensation of the fear, but don&#8217;t believe it. Give yourself some kindness.</li><li><strong>Remind yourself of a bigger truth</strong>. The idea that you should be on top of everything and working harder and checking emails and messages &#8230; it feels really true in the moment. But it is very rarely true. What&#8217;s a bigger truth? That you need rest to be able to serve others. That you are allowed to do other things, to spend time with others, to take care of yourself, to feel joy at spaciousness in your life. And this is a model for how others might live too. Taking rest serves the world. Remind yourself of this truth.</li><li><strong>Then take the rest</strong>. Feel in your heart how this is worthwhile. And let yourself enjoy the space. You don&#8217;t need to fill every moment with more work, more messages, more email.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>How would you like to practice with this for yourself?</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net/guilt/\">The Guilt of Not Working More, When We&#8217;re Done for the Day</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://zenhabits.net\">zen habits</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t</channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n",
